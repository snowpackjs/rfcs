# Summary

Improve DX and security around environment variables in Astro.

# Example

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig, envField } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
  env: {
    schema: {
      API_URL: z.static().private().string(),
      PUBLIC_FOO: z.static().public().string({ default: "bar" }),
      STRIPE_KEY: z.dynamic().private().string()
    }
  }
})
```

```ts
import { API_URL, PUBLIC_FOO } from "astro:env/static"
import { getEnv } from "astro:env/dynamic"

const stripeKey = getEnv("STRIPE_KEY")
```

# Background & Motivation

Env variables are an important part of any web application. You need to store sensitive data (think API secrets, tokens etc) without being leaked inside your git repo. But that's only the 1st part of the story. It's easy to leak this data by importing in the wrong place, eg. the frontend like [Resend a few weeks ago](https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-january-10-2024).

Other JS frameworks (eg. [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-private)) are handling env pretty well. From my understanding, the env story is currently a bit tricky in Astro. According to the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/), here is how env variables are currently handled:

- Astro uses Viteâ€™s built-in support for environment variables
- Static variables (ie. replaced statically at build time) are accessible via `import.meta.env`
- `import.meta.env` includes some [default variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables) like `SSR`, `BASE_URL`...
- A public variable key has to be prefixed by `PUBLIC_`
- A non public variable accessed using `import.meta.env` on the client side will be `undefined` (value will be accessible server side)
- Env variables can be loaded through `.env` (or `.env.production`, `.env.development`) and CLI
- Any non built-in variable can be [manually typed]([.env.production](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript))
- Runtime variables should be access using `process.env`, or following the used runtime (eg. `Deno.env.get()` for the deno adapter)

# Goals

A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining the intended goals of this RFC.

- What are the exact problems that you are trying to solve with this RFC?
- Separate these goals from the solution that you will outline below.
- If this RFC isn't approved, these goals can be used to develop alternative solutions.

# Non-Goals

A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining anything intentionally left out of this RFC:

- Non-goal: A goal that is intentionally not addressed in this RFC.
- Out-of-scope: A goal that is related, but intentionally avoided here.
- Future: A goal that is related, but left to be addressed in the future.

This gives the reader the correct context on what is intentionally left out of scope.
It is okay to leave this section empty.

# Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Astro to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Testing Strategy

How will this feature's implementation be tested? Explain if this can be tested with
unit tests or integration tests or something else. If relevant, explain the test
cases that will be added to cover all of the ways this feature might be used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity.
- Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space.
- Impact on teaching people Astro.
- Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- Cost of migrating existing Astro applications (_is it a breaking change?_)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

Please consider:

- If we implement this proposal, how will existing Astro developers adopt it?
- Is this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod?
- Can we provide a runtime adapter library for the original API it replaces?
- How will this affect other projects in the Astro ecosystem?

# Unresolved Questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts.
What parts of the design are still to be determined?
