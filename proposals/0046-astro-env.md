# Summary

Improve DX and security around environment variables in Astro.

# Example

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig, envField } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
  env: {
    schema: {
      API_URL: envField.string({ context: "server", access: "public" }),
      PUBLIC_FOO: envField.string({ context: "client", access: "public", default: "bar" }),
      STRIPE_KEY: envField.string({ context: "server", access: "secret" })
    }
  }
})
```

```ts
import { PUBLIC_FOO } from "astro:env/client"
import { API_URL, getSecret } from "astro:env/server"

const stripeKey = getSecret("STRIPE_KEY")
```

# Background & Motivation

Env variables are an important part of any web application. You need to store sensitive data (think API secrets, tokens etc) without being leaked inside your git repo. But that's only the 1st part of the story. It's easy to leak this data by importing in the wrong place, eg. the frontend like [Resend a few weeks ago](https://resend.com/blog/incident-report-for-january-10-2024).

Other JS frameworks (eg. [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-private)) are handling env pretty well. From my understanding, the env story is currently a bit tricky in Astro. According to the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/), here is how env variables are currently handled:

- Astro uses Viteâ€™s built-in support for environment variables
- Static variables (ie. replaced statically at build time) are accessible via `import.meta.env`
- `import.meta.env` includes some [default variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables) like `SSR`, `BASE_URL`...
- A public variable key has to be prefixed by `PUBLIC_`
- A non public variable accessed using `import.meta.env` on the client side will be `undefined` (value will be accessible server side)
- Env variables can be loaded through `.env` (or `.env.production`, `.env.development`) and CLI
- Any non built-in variable can be [manually typed]([.env.production](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript))
- Runtime variables should be access using `process.env`, or following the used runtime (eg. `Deno.env.get()` for the deno adapter)

# Goals

- Provide a fully type-safe experience for environment variables, without [manual type definitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript)
- Reduce user confusion between inlined, static variables and dynamic, runtime variables
- Allow adapters to specify how runtime env variables should be handled
- Allow integrations to define environment variable constraints
- Simple type casting and validation (strings/numbers/booleans, required/optional)

# Non-Goals

- Complex validation or type casting of env variables. We might want to enable this at some point, but there is likely a performance cost for this at runtime. We should punt on this if possible!
- Future: allow adapters to customize build-time variable handling. Better runtime handling is the most important problem this proposal aims to solve, but if we find an API that enables this as well, that's great.

# Detailed Design

## Terminology

- **Public variable**: variable replaced by its value at build time
- **Secret variable**: variable retrieved at runtime, never part of the bundle. Uses runtime specific features, like `process.env` or `Deno.env.get()`
- **Server variable**: variable available server-side only
- **Client variable**: variable available client-side only

## Astro config

A new `env.schema` property is added to `AstroUserConfig`. Its type looks like so:

```ts
type StringField = {
  type: "string"
  optional?: boolean
  default?: string
}

type NumberField = {
  type: "number"
  optional?: boolean
  default?: number
}

type BooleanField = {
  type: "boolean"
  optional?: boolean
  default?: boolean
}

type EnvFieldType = StringField | NumberField | BooleanField

type PublicClientEnvFieldMetadata = {
  context: "client"
  access: "public"
}

type PublicServerEnvFieldMetadata = {
  context: "server"
  access: "public"
}

type SecretServerEnvFieldMetadata = {
  context: "server"
  access: "secret"
}

type EnvSchema = Record<string, (PublicClientEnvFieldMetadata | PublicServerEnvFieldMetadata | SecretServerEnvFieldMetadata) & EnvFieldType>

type AstroUserConfig = {
  env?: {
    schema: EnvSchema
  }
}
```

We provide a `envField` helper to make it easier to define the schema:

```ts
import { envField } from "astro/config"

// { context: "client", access: "public", type: "number", default: 4321 }
envField.number({ context: "client", access: "public", default: 4321 })

// { context: "server", access: "secret", type: "string" }
envField.string({ context: "server", access: "secret" })
```

Note that a variable is required by default, and can be made optional with `optional: true` or `default: value`.

## Integrations

The above way of declaring the schema allows integrations to declare their own constraints from inside `astro:config:setup` without any special handling:

```ts
import { envField } from "astro/config"
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro"

const integration = {
  name: "supabase-integration",
  hooks: {
    "astro:config:setup": (params) => {
      params.updateConfig({
        env: {
          schema: {
            PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: envField.string({ context: "client", access: "public" })
          }
        }
      })
    }
  }
} satisfies AstroIntegration
```

## Public variables

Public variables are checked at some point between `astro:config:setup` and `astro:server:setup`. Since we don't/won't support many data structures, custom validators are used for the validation. They will also be used for secret variables at runtime.

If the variable is marked as client only, it will be available through the `astro:env/client` virtual module. If it's marked as server only, it will be available through `astro:env/server` instead (importing this module client side will trigger an `AstroError`).

```ts
declare module "astro:env/client" {
  export const PUBLIC_FOO: boolean
}

declare module "astro:env/server" {
  export const BAR: boolean
  // more in this module below
}

import { PUBLIC_FOO } from "astro:env/client"
import { BAR } from "astro:env/server"
```

## Secret variables

Secret variables by default use a Node.js compatible API to retrieve env variables (likely based on `process.env`). However, adapters can provide their own implementations.

> TODO: see what api makes most sense, probably an entrypoint but it also needs to be request dependent for Cloudflare

Variables specified in the schema are accessible (and well typed) whereas unknown ones are typed more loosely. They will be able in the `astro:env/server` virtual module:

```ts
declare module "astro:env/server" {
  type SecretValues = {
    "FOO": boolean
    "BAR": string
  }

  type SecretValue = keyof SecretValues

  type Loose<T> = T | (string & {})
  type Strictify<T extends string> = T extends `${infer _}` ? T : never

  export const getSecret: <TKey extends Loose<SecretValue>>(key: TKey) => TKey extends Strictify<SecretValue> ? SecretValues[TKey] : (string | undefined)
}

import { getSecret } from "astro:env/dynamic"

getSecret("KNOWN_KEY") // whatever type defined in the schema
getSecret("UNKNOWN_KEY") // string | undefined
```

Under the hood, this feature relies on [Async Local Storage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html). For instance, this will require the cloudflare adapter to implement a codemod to enable the TODO:flag_name flag in `wrangler.toml`.

Values will be validated at runtime using the same custom validators as static variables. If the key passed is not found in the schema, it will either return a string (ie. raw value) or undefined. It's the adapter duty to handle what variables to return (eg. the Cloudflare adapter should not return a R2 binding).

# Testing Strategy

Unit tests will be made for:
- Custom validators

E2e test will be made for:
- Testing public/private
- Testing static/dynamic
- Integrations

Features will be implemented incrementally using feature flags:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    env: {
      schema: {}
    }
  }
})
```

# Drawbacks / integration

- The implementation in terms of code size and complexity seems reasonable. It shouldn't affect too many parts of the codebase
- The user can be implemented in userland, although more limited (eg. exposing apis to adapter is not possible without integrations inter-communication), see https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/astro-env/pull/4
- This feature requires update across the docs as the official recommendation, although it's not breaking
- Other parts of Astro need this, for example integrations like `@astrojs/db`

# Alternatives

## Typed `import.meta.env`

https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/astro-env currently does [manual typing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript) on behalf of the user. It's too basic and only handles static variables.

## Secret variables using `Astro.env`

The issue restrict secret variables usage inside `.astro` files (or endpoints `context`). It's common to be able to use it outside, eg. in `.ts`. That's why it uses an ALS.

## Using zod

Using zod in the public interface isn't great as `.env` files remain strings, so it requires more work to get right ([especially for booleans](https://env.t3.gg/docs/recipes#booleans)) and we only support a tiny subset of zod APIs.

We've also considered using it under the hood. While it's not an issue for public variables (build time, part of the bundle), it would increase the bundle for runtime usage significantly.

## Providing fields helpers in a function

Instead of exporting `envField` from `astro/config`, it has been considered to be provided as a function argument of `schema`:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  env: {
    schema: (fields) => ({
      FOO: fields.string()
    })
  }
})
```

It's not great because:
- It's not serializable
- It can cause side-effects (if you call something before returning the object)
- It makes merging in `updateConfig` (Integrations API) harder

## Dedicated `env.ts`

Having a dedicated entrypoint has been considered, mainly to play better with a zod based API:

```ts
import { defineEnv } from "astro/config"
import { z } from "astro/zod"

export default defineEnv({
  FOO: z.string()
})
```

It was too restrictive and caused 2 issues:
- Users could forget to use the default export
- Auto-complete could point to this file instead of virtual imports when typing `env`

Note using such convention is still possible using the current proposal:

```ts
// env.ts
import { envField } from "astro/config"

export const envSchema = {
  FOO: envField.string({ context: "server", access: "public" })
}

// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
import { envSchema } from "./env"

export default defineConfig({
  env: {
    schema: envSchema
  }
})
```

# Adoption strategy

- **If we implement this proposal, how will existing Astro developers adopt it?**
  - They should not use [manual typing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript) anymore
  - Any custom env var (ie. not built-in like `SSR`) used with `import.meta.env` should be added to `env.schema` and imported through `astro:env/static/public` or `astro:env/static/private`

  ```diff
  // astro.config.mjs
  import {
    defineConfig,
  +  envField
  } from "astro/config"

  export default defineConfig({
  +  env: {
  +    schema: {
  +      PUBLIC_API_URL: envField.string({ context: "client", access: "public" })
  +    }
  +  }
  })

  // whatever.ts
  - import.meta.env.PUBLIC_API_URL
  + import { PUBLIC_API_URL } from "astro:env/client"
  ```
  
- **Is this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod?**
  - This is not breaking
  - A codemod could help migrate, although not required. It may require too much efforts, given how codemods are hard to write
- **How will this affect other projects in the Astro ecosystem?**
  - This is not breaking for users projects nor integrations
  - Only my integration `astro-env` aims to provide the same features, so it will be deprecated
  - Integrations adding manual environment checks like https://github.com/MatthiesenXYZ/astro-ghostcms/ will be able to migrate

# Unresolved Questions

- How should the Adapter API look?
- What's the name of the Cloudflare flag to enable the ALS?
